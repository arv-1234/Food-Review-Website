            <h1 class="introT"><u>Top 5 Best Resteraunts in Toronto</u></h1>

            <h2 class="num1Rank">1. Alo Restaurant</h2>
            <img class="R1" src="Alo.jpg" alt="Alo Restaurant">
            <p class="rank1P">
                When Alo opened in 2015 with its high-concept French cuisine, it didn’t take long for
                it to top critic’s choice lists around the world. The naysayers eventually became believers.
                The space is elegant and filled with natural light. There is also an adequate amount of room
                to move around. Anybody willing to commit to a five-course is bound to enjoy everything the
                restaurant has to offer. The cocktails available include house mixtures and the classics and
                favourites. Alo has some of the best wines in Canada, with pricey and approachable bottles.
                The menu takes ingredients and flavours from all over the world and adds a classic French
                twist to it. Also, the menu changes with the seasons so you will have encounter different foods at different
                times.
            </p>

            <h2 class="num2Rank">2. Chubby's Jamaican</h2>
            <img class="R2" src="chubbys.jpg" alt="Chubby's Jamaican Kitchen">
            <p class="rank2P">
                Chubbys is for those who enjoy eating jerk with their hands while drinking some
                signature house cocktails. The drinks they serve are almost as good as the jerk. The tropical
                versions of classic cocktails are loved by many. If you are in a large group try out some of
                the jumbo options like the jumbo pina colada. This is the best place for Jamaican food in
                Toronto. There are great burgers and salty fish fritters, but the main course is the jerk
                chicken, which takes about four days to prepare. Make room for dessert, the creamy
                goodness provides a nice balance to the jerk’s heat. So whenever you get a craving for spicy
                food, especially during the winter, you know where to go.
            </p>

            <h2 class="num3Rank">3. Canoe Restaurant</h2>
            <img class="R3" src="canoe.jpg" alt="Canoe Restaurant">
            <p class="rank3P">
                Canoe has the best view in Toronto, the CN Tower on one side and the planes
                landing at the airport on the other. The food is just as good as where the restaurant is
                located. If you want to celebrate a special occasion this is the place to go. The menu has an
                incredible blend of flavours and ingredients from all across Canada. You will find fine Ontario
                produce and foie gras from Quebec. Their service is exceptional. The glasses are always
                filled and your cutlery will be replaced quickly. When you have to make a big impression or
                you just have money to blow Canoe is the place to do it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="num4Rank">4. The Jerk Box</h2>
            <img class="R4" src="jerk.jpg" alt="The Jerk Box">
            <p class="rank4P">
                The Jerk Box serves delicious Jamaican food for breakfast, lunch and dinner
                including some tasty desserts. Customers line up at this restaurant for the mouthwatering
                food served from a hot plate. The types of soup and porridge that change
                throughout the week and starting 7 am breakfast is available. Most of the items available
                for lunch include chicken dressed in spices, bringing out the jerk
                flavouring. The classic jerk chicken is juicy and flavourful. You can eat it in many different
                ways like getting it fried, BBQ’d or even as a stew. Other than the hot meals, there is a
                great selection of desserts such as rum cake, cherry sponge cake and velvet cake. This
                place is a go-to spot for many in the area so why not take a chance? And try it out.
            </p>

            <h2 class="num5Rank">5. Cabano's Comfort Food</h2>
            <img class="R5" src="comfort.jpg" alt="Cabano's Comfort Food">
            <p class="rank5P">
                Cabanos comfort food is phenomenal. It easily has the best chicken sandwich in the
                GTA. Great customer service and an especially clean environment (very important
                during the covid pandemic!). Definitely in the higher price range in terms of comfort
                food, although the price is justified. The chicken sandwich was very well made with a
                perfect contrast between the soft bun and crispy fried chicken as well as the rich
                Cabano sauce and tangy pickles. The chicken wings tossed with the burnt chile
                sauce are my favourite out of all the other signature house-made sauces. This is a
                must-eat place! So make sure to check it out if you have the chance.
