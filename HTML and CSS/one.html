                Reviewing food started as a hobby. But it eventually grew into something bigger. We started as a small group of friends with a love and appreciation for
                food. Publishing our reviews online hoping that our words play a role in someoneâ€™s decision to eat at a specific spot. Eventually, our love for reviewing 
                food inspired us to start Top Foods. We began a bit slow. However, as time went by we became the business we are today. We pride ourselves on providing the
                best information possible about restaurants near you. Here at Top Foods, we have written reviews of over 130 restaurants all across Canada! Top Foods has over 
                20 locations all over the country and it continues to expand every day. Although times are tuff right now, we are hard at work to keep you updated on all the available 
                delicious food.
